# PySAMP
Using PySAMP in your SA-MP server allows you to create gamemodes with the python language. All API-functions, callbacks and constants except timers and http functions can be accessed in python. 
In case of the call-by-reference functions like ```GetPlayerName``` are returning the value instead of using a reference, since call-by-reference isn't possible in python.
The following example shows the difference.

```C
public OnPlayerConnect(playerid)
{
  new name[MAX_PLAYER_NAME], string[MAX_PLAYER_NAME + 24];
  GetPlayerName(playerid, name, MAX_PLAYER_NAME);
  format(string, sizeof(string), "%s has joined the server.", name);
  SendClientMessageToAll(0x000000FF, string);
}
```

```python
from samp import *
from const import *

def on_player_connect(playerid):
    name = get_player_name(playerid, MAX_PLAYER_NAME.get())
    send_client_message_to_all(0x000000FF,  '%s has joined the server.'.format(name))
    return 1
```

As you can see, all referenced return values are removed and instead the method returns either a value or a tuple.
The corresponding python gamemode has to be saved as `gamemode.py` in a `python/` subfolder of your server directory.
By the way, I imported the `samp` module here, which is actually a python module. You can find it in `gamemodes/empty/`.
It wraps the SA-MP functions and handles the encoding and decoding of strings, so you don't have to bother.
*Caution:* with this module, you also get the decode method. Use it to decode the bytestrings as seen in the example gamemode in `gamemodes/empty/`.


# Getting Started

There are three different ways to install the plugin depending on your system. Recommended and supported are the first two ways:

  <summary>Windows<br></summary>

  <hr>
  Using PySAMP on a Windows machine is fairly easy.
  Just set your server up and copy the `pysamp-launcher.bat` from the current release to the server directory and start it. It automatically checks all preconditions and downloads an embedded python interpreter automatically. It then sets up the environment path and starts the server itself. It should be then used as a launcher-script to start the server; so use it to start your server as of now.

## Run using docker
### Requirements
- Docker 20.10.0 or greater. Previous versions may work, but they are not tested. Read more [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) how to install docker on your specific Linux Distribution
- Your user needs to be added to the docker group

### How to get started?
With our docker setup, you can run your entire SA-MP server inside a docker container. Under `/server` you will find a 0.3.7 server root folder as you would recognise it. Our docker setup builds the container, generates the PySAMP runtime / plugin, and afterwards uses the `server` directory to start up a SA-MP server for you.


1. If you haven't already, please clone the latest main branch of the [repository](https://github.com/habecker/PySAMP/tree/main).  You can clone the repository to your server using `git clone https://github.com/habecker/PySAMP.git`
2. Proceed to the `/docker` folder inside the repo, here you can find the docker-related files. Inspect the files if you need to know what they do in detail.
3. Next up, let us make the bash-scripts executable by running `chmod +x *.sh` inside the `/docker` folder.
4. From the same folder (`/docker`), run the SA-MP server located in `/server` by running `./server.sh`, and gently wait for the process to complete. This will build the docker container and start your server.

### Default actions and notes
- If there are no existing `/server` directory, it will be created. SA-MP server version 0.3.7-R3  will be downloaded and installed.
- If there are no gamemode in `/server/gamemodes` called `empty.amx`, the docker container will then put that there to get the server started. If you have defined a different gamemode in `/server/server.cfg`, this file will not be loaded.
- If there is no filterscript in `/server/filterscripts` called `empty.amx`, the docker container will put that there when the server starts. If you have defined other filterscripts in `/server/server.cfg`, this file will not be loaded.
- The [Crashdetect](https://github.com/Zeex/samp-plugin-crashdetect) plugin is added automatically, unless it already exists.
- Server starts at port 7777 and it is exposed at port 7777. If you change the port in the `/server/server.cfg`, you will also need to change the docker arguments in `/docker/server.sh`. For example, if you want to run on port 8888, the last line should contain `-p 8888:8888 -p 8888:8888/udp` instead of `-p 7777:7777 -p 7777:7777/udp`.

  <summary>Manual Installation (not recommended, unsupported)<br></summary>
  <hr>
 
  1. Install Python 3.8.6 (32 bit Version is <b>required</b>)
  1. Copy the PySAMP.so to the plugins directory of your server
  1. create a python directory on your server
  1. copy gamemode.py, samp.py and const.py to the directory (samp.py and const.py are also needed to be copied on any update!)
